# Introduction

### `vue-tiny-validate` Tiny (2.5KB minified) Vue Validate Composition

## Motivation

During the time of refactoring our project, we were coped with so many challenges. One of them was to minimize bundle
size of the external libraries. Over time, the Vue community has seen so many great validation tools, such as
[Vuelidate](https://github.com/vuelidate/vuelidate) or [vee-validate](https://github.com/logaretm/vee-validate). They
are all great.

However, most (or maybe all) of them are over **3KB** that we think it's way too much for just a validation library.
We want a **minimal** but **robust** and **fully supported** one.

That's why `vue-tiny-validate` was born.

## Features

- Easy. Come with familiar API and coherent documentation.
- Tiny. No dependencies. Only 2.5KB minified.
- Flexible. Full control over everything.
- Fully functional. Sync validation, async validation, etc supported.

## About

- This library is heavily inspired from [Vuelidate](https://github.com/vuelidate/vuelidate).
- Created by [Anh Le](https://github.com/culee) from [ShopBase Front Team](https://github.com/FrontLabsOfficial).
