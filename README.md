## `vue-tiny-validate`

Tiny Vue Validate Composition

## Motivation

During the time of refactoring our project, we have coped with so many challenges, one of which was to minimize bundle
size of the external libraries. We looked for a solution in the Vue community, and we have seen so many great validation
tools, namely [Vuelidate](https://github.com/vuelidate/vuelidate) or
[vee-validate](https://github.com/logaretm/vee-validate). They were all great, but they weren't the best fit for our
problem at hand.

Most, or maybe all of them, are over **10KB** minified. This was way too heavy for our goal of keeping our validation library
**robust**, **fully-supported**, and most importantly, **minimal**.

That's why `vue-tiny-validate` was born.

## Features

- Easy. Come with familiar API and coherent documentation.
- Tiny. Only **3.4KB** minified. **1.4KB** gzipped.
- Flexible. Full control over everything.
- Fully functional. Sync validation, async validation, etc supported.
- Compatible. Works with both Vue 2.6 and Vue 3.

## Usage

- See [docs](https://vue-tiny-validate.netlify.app) for more detail.
